# MyNotes

This is a project entirely made with Android Studio and Java for taking notes in your phone. 

It is capable of creating checklists, simple notes and you can attach alarms on notes.

This project has helped me to start programming in Android: RecyclerViews, Room Database, LiveData, WorkManager and many more components. A stable version was build to be uploaded to GitHub. 

At the time, WorkManager is not working on real devices but only on emulator devices.

#Â Installation

To run the project make sure to Clean Project and then Rebuild Project in Android Studio if any error appears.
