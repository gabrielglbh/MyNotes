# MyNotes

This is a project entirely made with Android Studio and Java for taking notes in your phone.

It is capable of creating checklists, simple notes and you can attach alarms on notes.

This project has helped to start programming in Android: RecyclerViews, Room Database, LiveData, WorkManager and many more components.
